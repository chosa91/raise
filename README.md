Hey Joe,
 
I wanted to take some time with you to talk about my **compensation** for this year. I know this is never a fun discussion to have, but I feel this is a good time to **align our interests** in the mutual benefit of our company.
 
My last compensation update was in **May 2019**, when I went from **$80,000** to **$83,000**, after starting on my current Software Engineering role.
 
To frame the conversation, I wanted to quickly summarize some of the things that I've been working on since last year. This list is not comprehensive and it is chronologically ordered:

* I **architected** and **implemented** the **synchronization process** between our legacy database and the S3 bucket that’s currently powering all of our marketing activities. The previous process took 14 hours to complete, and the new solution I designed **brought that down to less than an hour**.

* I put together the **documentation to assess and review** all of our new hires. Thanks to this process, the leadership team has a **strong mechanism** to evaluate performance, and team members **feel connected** to the inputs and outputs coming in and out of their reviews.

* I started the development of our **open-source library**, and so far we have gotten a **lot of traction** from the community. Thanks to that, our marketing team is pursuing **several leads** that came straight from the team using our tools. I continue working on the library and **owning the main core component**.

* I’m currently **leading the team** that’s working with Acme Inc. in the development of their **mobile application**. The client has repeatedly mentioned the **huge impact that our work is having** in their organization.

There's certainly more, but hopefully, this serves as the foundation for this request.
 
Taking into account my current responsibilities, the value that I bring to the company, and the current market salary for my position, I'd like to request an update to my compensation that puts me at **$94,375**. 
 
I'd like to be sensitive to the current market conditions, so I’d be happy to discuss and come up with a plan that works for everyone. 
 
There's no rush, think about this and get back to me when you are ready.
 
Looking forward to your thoughts
 
Thanks,

Mary.
